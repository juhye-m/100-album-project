Pseudocode and TODOs

NEXT
- perhaps work in jupyter notebook elsewhere
- be able to see audio features more clearly in the df
- think about what data analysis i actually want next
    - average duration, HH:MM:SS - DONE
    - average audio features for each individual album

2
given multiple Artist names and Album titles in a CSV, retrieve album info
output the average duration (calculate)
what other data do i want?
    it seems like genres often are empty
    perhaps, later, getting the copyright or label info (how many albums i liked were from major record labels)

3 individual tracks' audio features (dancebility etc)

4 - simple visualizations
visualize number of tracks as a bar graph

5 ranking albums 
pairwise comparison
manual
etc

6 - more complex data analysis with other sources
pulling from billboard and comparing

7 - website for others to use to analyze their own data
