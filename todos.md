Pseudocode and TODOs

TODO
- Data Analysis:
    - total number of songs listened to (easy)
    - avg number of songs on an album (easy)
    - total duration listened to (easy)
    - rating stuff (later)

- Visualizations - i think these would be more interesting with more comparative data analysis though / after ratings, not these basic ones, since this is just what i straight up chose to listen to
    - (basic info of what i listened to / the data)
    - release year bar graph
    - genre bubbles
    - genre distribution pie chart

    - finding relationships:
    - Popularity vs. Duration: explore if there's a relationship between album duration and its popularity.
    
    - audio features?

    - most interesting visualizations/analysis will come after my ratings
        - my ratings VS popularity score of the album
        - is there a pattern of audio features i like more / are higher with higher ratings


- create an algorithm for my own ratings as a number to compare to smth like popularity score (research how pop score is calculated)


DONE
- work in jupyter notebook
- be able to see audio features more clearly in the df
- think about what data analysis i actually want next
    - average duration, HH:MM:SS
    - average audio features for each individual album

IDEAS
2
given multiple Artist names and Album titles in a CSV, retrieve album info
output the average duration (calculate)
what other data do i want?
    it seems like genres often are empty
    perhaps, later, getting the copyright or label info (how many albums i liked were from major record labels)

3 individual tracks' audio features (dancebility etc)

4 - simple visualizations
visualize number of tracks as a bar graph

5 ranking albums 
pairwise comparison
manual
etc

6 - more complex data analysis with other sources
pulling from billboard and comparing

7 - website for others to use to analyze their own data
